              <p>A Studio 22 Film</p>
              <p>Written and Directed by Alex Tannebaum</p>
              <p>Produced by Erika Rodriguez and Avery Powell</p>
              <p class="log">Three college-aged friends’ psychedelic search for a sense of self-worth.</p>
              <div class="statement">
                <p><span class="tab">I want to make (as we have yet to shoot this) a film that captures
                  suburban kids in the odd post-teenager, pre-adult phase of life.
                  As children, we’re impulsive, we do what makes us feel good. As
                  we get older, we learn to think about our actions and avoid cognitive
                  dissonance. On top of this, and specific to the suburbs, growing
                  up in and around money, kids are constantly told: “You are special.
                  You are lucky.” Of course, some kids do exceptional things, but
                  those aren’t our characters.</p>
                <p><span class="tab">So here is a slice-of-life story of a couple of rich kids with
                  the impulses of children, but the need to rationalize of a couple
                  of adults that think they’re inherently special. They need to
                  feel special, even as they’re challenged by the world and each
                  other. The style of the film was heavily inspired by Easy Rider,
                  as it depicts a certain type of people in a specific time and a
                  recognizable place—without taking a strong position on their actions.
                  It revels in a sense of freedom, and specifically in Fly in the
                  Ointment, the privilege of this freedom is examined through
                  psychedelic fun and rock music over the course of a day in the
                  life.</p>
                <p><span class="tab">I wanted to write a short that would function well as a short,
                  instead of a crunched up feature in 20 minutes. I wanted to root
                  it in my identity, something I could say that no one else could
                  or at least no one is. Stories like this, about the white and
                  rich, should not necessarily be in the spotlight right now,
                  but I think many people from a similar background will relate
                  to the classic suburban day trip—going downtown to the same 2
                  square mile block with a few of your friends, just to feel a
                  little something different. </p>
